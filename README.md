## Challenge Exercise 1

In `comparenumbers.py` file, write a python program that asks the user to input two numbers. The program will then compare the two numbers and print a comparison if the first number is equal to, less than, or greater than the second number. i.e.

- if the first number is 4 and the second number is 4, the program will print
    
    ```
    4 is equal to 4
    ```

- if the first number is 7 and the second number is 3, the program will print
    
    ```
    7 is greater than 3
    ```

- if the first number is 2 and the second number is 8, the program will print
    
    ```
    2 is less than 8
    ```

## Challenge Exercise 2

In `allthenumbers.py` file, write a python program that asks the user to input a number, then prints out all numbers up to and including that number, starting from 1.
		
If the input is not a number, the program will print `input is not a number` to user.
